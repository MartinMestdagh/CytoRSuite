\usage{
\S4method{drawGate}{GatingSet}(x, groupBy = length(x), select = NULL,
  parent = "root", alias = NULL, channels = NULL, type = "polygon",
  subSample = 250000, gtfile = NULL, axis = "x", adjust = 1.5,
  labels = TRUE, plot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class
\code{\link[flowWorkspace:GatingSet-class]{GatingSet}}.}

\item{groupBy}{numeric (e.g. 2) or vector of pData column names (e.g.
c("Treatment","Concentration") indicating how the samples should be grouped
prior to gating, set to the length of x by default to construct a single
gate for all samples. If groupBy is suppied a different gate will be
constructed for each group.}

\item{select}{vector containing the indicies of samples within each group to
use for plotting.}

\item{parent}{name of the \code{parent} population to extract for gating.}

\item{alias}{the name(s) of the populations to be gated. If multiple
population names are supplied (e.g. \code{c("CD3,"CD4)}) multiple gates
will be returned. \code{alias} is \code{NULL} by default which will halt
the gating routine.}

\item{channels}{vector of channel names to use for plotting, can be of length
1 for 1-D density histogram or length 2 for 2-D scatter plot.}

\item{type}{vector of gate type names used to construct the gates. Multiple
gate types are supported but should be accompanied with an \code{alias}
argument of the same length (i.e. one \code{type} per \code{alias}).
Supported gate types are \code{polygon, rectangle, ellipse, threshold,
boundary, interval, quadrant and web} which can be abbreviated as upper or
lower case first letters as well. Default \code{type} is \code{"interval"}
for 1D gates and \code{"polygon"} for 2D gates.}

\item{subSample}{numeric indicating the number of events to plot, set to all
events by default. Reducing the sample size can significantly increase
plotting speed on less powerful machines.}

\item{gtfile}{name of \code{gatingTemplate} csv file to be saved.}

\item{axis}{indicates whether the \code{"x"} or \code{"y"} axis should be
gated for 2-D interval gates.}

\item{adjust}{smooothing factor passed to
\code{\link[stats:density]{density}} for 1-D plots (defaults to 1.5).}

\item{labels}{logical indicating whether to include \code{\link{plotLabels}}
for the gated population(s), \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{plot}{logical indicating whether a plot should be drawn, set to
\code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for \code{\link{plotCyto,GatingSet-method}}.}
}
\value{
drawn gates are applied to the
  \code{\link[flowWorkspace:GatingSet-class]{GatingSet}} and saved to a
  \code{\link[openCyto:gatingTemplate-class]{gatingTemplate}}.
